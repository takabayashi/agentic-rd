# Implementation TODO — Wikipedia Edit-Triage Agent

Incremental build plan derived from [`docs/requirements.md`](./requirements.md) and
the take-home brief ([`docs/RedpandaTakehome.pdf`](./RedpandaTakehome.pdf)). Each
phase is small, independently verifiable, and ends in a runnable state.

**Conventions**
- `[ ]` = not started, `[x]` = done.
- Every phase carries lightweight **Security** and **Docs** notes plus an explicit
  **Acceptance criteria** block (each criterion is testable / observable).
- Do one phase at a time; don't start the next until acceptance criteria pass.

**Scope discipline (why this list is short).** The brief is an explicit
*couple-of-hours* exercise graded on judgment, not surface area: "plain but
works", "one command brings it up", "README is short and honest". So the plan
builds exactly the evaluated path — **ingest → transform → reason → serve** — and
deliberately omits gold-plating (deploy automation, dependency bots, a metrics
stack, elaborate UI). Anything cut is listed under **Out of scope** with a reason.

> **Revision (this pass):** consolidated 13 phases → 10. Merged Connect ingest +
> transform, merged Ollama infra + pass-1, folded the standalone "observability"
> phase's *useful* parts (output retries/backoff + clean logs) into the end-to-end
> sink phase and dropped the metrics view, trimmed UI and test scope to
> "plain but works", and capped CI at the lightweight setup already in place
> (no further CI/CD expansion). The required README write-up keeps its own final
> phase because it is the most heavily graded deliverable.

## Phase 0 — Project skeleton & health *(done)*

> Goal: a repo that starts cleanly with one command and serves a trivial page.

- [x] `git init`; `.gitignore` (`.env`, `__pycache__`, `.venv`, `.DS_Store`)
- [x] `app/main.py`: FastAPI with `GET /` → `{"status":"ok"}` and `GET /healthz` → 200
- [x] `app/requirements.txt` (fastapi, uvicorn) + `app/Dockerfile` (pinned base image)
- [x] `app/tests/test_health.py`: asserts `/healthz` returns 200
- [x] `docker-compose.yml` with the `webapp` service on port 8080
- [x] **Security:** `.env.example`; `.env` gitignored; pinned image tags; no secrets committed
- [x] **Docs:** `README.md` skeleton — one-line description + "Run" section

**Acceptance criteria**
- [x] `docker compose up` starts cleanly and the webapp stays running
- [x] `curl localhost:8080/healthz` → HTTP 200
- [x] `pytest` passes locally
- [x] `git status` shows `.env` ignored; no secret values tracked

## Phase 1 — Lightweight CI *(done; intentionally minimal)*

> Goal: every push is linted, built, and tested so the repo stays trustworthy.
> Deliberately capped here — CI is **not** part of the brief, so it stays small.

- [x] GitHub Actions: `ruff` lint + format check, `pytest`, `docker compose build`
- [x] Secret-scan job (`gitleaks`) over full history; least-privilege `GITHUB_TOKEN` (`contents: read`)
- [x] **Security:** `gitleaks` clean; no secrets in tracked files
- [x] **Docs:** README "CI/CD" section + status badge

**Acceptance criteria**
- [x] `ruff check` / `ruff format --check` / `pytest` / `gitleaks detect` pass locally
- [ ] First push to GitHub shows the workflow green *(verify once, non-blocking)*

> **Capped scope:** GHCR deploy, Dependabot, branch-protection, and extra
> Dockerfile/YAML linters are extras beyond the brief. The minimal pieces that
> already exist are kept; **no further CI/CD work is planned** (see Out of scope).

## Phase 2 — Dashboard with mocked data

> Goal: the moderator view exists and looks right, fed by a hardcoded fixture.
> No DB or pipeline yet — nail the "plain but works" view first.

- [x] Define the edit view-model (`rev_id, title, editor, comment, label, confidence, escalated, size_delta, uri, event_ts, classified_at`) — `app/models.py`
- [x] `MOCK_EDITS` fixture covering all 4 labels + one escalated row + empty state (`AGENTIC_EMPTY=1`) — `app/mock_data.py`
- [x] Jinja2 table: label badge, confidence, title link (`rel="noopener noreferrer"`), Δbytes, comment, time; sorted by confidence desc; label filter links (`all/vandalism/substantive/trivia/unclear`) with counts; 15s auto-refresh
- [x] `GET /api/edits?label=` returning the view-model as JSON
- [x] **Security:** confirmed Jinja2 autoescaping is ON (title/comment are untrusted attacker text); external links `rel="noopener noreferrer"`
- [x] **Docs:** documented the `/api/edits` response shape (README "Dashboard & API")

**Acceptance criteria**
- [x] `/` renders all 4 label badges + an escalated marker, sorted by confidence desc
- [x] A label filter narrows the table
- [x] `/api/edits?label=vandalism` returns only vandalism rows as valid JSON
- [x] A `<script>` injected in a mock title renders escaped (not executed)

## Phase 3 — Postgres: schema, seeds, real serving

> Goal: the UI reads from a real store instead of mocks.

- [x] Add `postgres:16` (pinned `16.14`) to compose with a `pg_isready` healthcheck; gate `webapp` on `service_healthy`
- [x] `db/init.sql`: `classified_edits` (`rev_id` BIGINT PK, `label` CHECK enum, confidence 0–1 CHECK, escalated, timestamps, `event_ts DESC` index)
- [x] `db/seed.sql` (mirrors the Phase 2 fixture, idempotent `ON CONFLICT`) so the dashboard has data without the pipeline
- [x] Swap the mock source → parameterized `psycopg` query in `app/db.py` (`get_recent_edits`); DB-not-ready fallback (graceful 503 warm-up, no crash)
- [x] **Security:** DB creds from env only (`POSTGRES_*` / `DATABASE_URL`); SQL is parameterized (`%s`, no interpolation); default-password change documented
- [x] **Docs:** schema doc (columns + why `rev_id` PK / UPSERT rationale); `psql` connect snippet (README "Database")

**Acceptance criteria**
- [x] `docker compose up` brings up Postgres healthy and the app serves seeded rows
- [x] `/` and `/api/edits` reflect `db/seed.sql` (5 rows; `?label=vandalism` → 1)
- [x] Stopping Postgres yields a graceful 503 (no crash); restarting recovers (verified: 200)
- [x] An out-of-enum label is rejected by the CHECK constraint (`classified_edits_label_check`)

## Phase 4 — Connect ingest + transform (filter, project)

> Goal: pull the real firehose and turn it into a clean, model-ready schema.
> No LLM yet — temporary `stdout` sink. **Connect-only**: the broker + Console
> are deferred to the sink phase (nothing consumes a topic yet), and dedup is
> deferred to the Postgres `rev_id` UPSERT (Phase 7), so no in-pipeline cache.

- [x] Standalone `connect` service (pinned `connect:4.95.0`) mounting `connect/wikipedia.yaml`: `http_client` SSE input (`stream.enabled`, `lines` scanner, `omit_empty`) with descriptive `User-Agent`
- [x] Parse frames: keep `data:` lines, strip prefix; `parse_json().catch(deleted())` to fail-closed on heartbeats (not `if`)
- [x] Filter + project in one pass (root rebuilt as a whole object): keep `type=edit`, `bot=false`, `namespace=0`, **`server_name=en.wikipedia.org`**; build clean schema incl. `size_delta` (int64); `deleted()` the rest
- [x] Convert epoch → ISO for `event_ts` (TIMESTAMPTZ-safe) via `ts_format`, fallback to `meta.dt`; cast `rev_id`/`size_delta` to int64 (avoids float/sci-notation in the diff URL)
- [x] **Security:** set `WIKI_USER_AGENT` (Wikipedia 403s without it); treat title/comment as untrusted data throughout
- [x] **Docs:** document source choice, SSE quirks, the User-Agent requirement, the filter rationale (incl. en.wikipedia scoping)

**Acceptance criteria**
- [x] Connect logs a steady stream of clean projected JSON to stdout
- [x] Only main-namespace, non-bot English-Wikipedia `edit`s survive; each has all schema fields
- [x] `event_ts` is valid ISO-8601 (no raw epoch); `size_delta` correct (incl. negatives)
- [x] Runs ≥2 min without crashing on heartbeats / non-JSON lines (validated: 0 restarts, 0 errors, 239 records)

> Dedup criterion moved to Phase 7 (Postgres `rev_id` UPSERT is the durable
> backstop; SSE rarely re-sends a `rev_id`).

## Phase 5 — LLM pass-1 classification (Ollama) + robust parse

> Goal: a reachable local model gives every surviving edit a normalized
> `{label, confidence}`.

- [x] `ollama` service + one-shot `ollama-pull` to preload the model; gate `connect` on pull completion (`OLLAMA_MODEL`, `OLLAMA_ADDRESS` env-configurable)
- [x] Pass-1 `branch`: `request_map` builds the prompt (title + comment + `size_delta`); `ollama_chat`; `result_map` grafts result back (don't overwrite the record)
- [x] Robust parse: extract first `{...}` block, fallback `{}` on failure, normalize label to the enum (`.string().trim().lowercase()` + map), default `unclear`, coerce confidence to a number
- [x] **Security:** constrain output to the fixed enum so prompt-injection can't change behavior; result is advisory only (no data leaves the host)
- [x] **Docs:** document model choice + how to change it; first-run pull time; the pass-1 prompt + parse/normalize rules

**Acceptance criteria**
- [x] `ollama-pull` completes; model appears in `ollama list`; `connect` waits (no cold-start "model not found" race)
- [x] Records carry `label ∈ {vandalism,substantive,trivia,unclear}` and `confidence ∈ [0,1]` (validated live: e.g. "We use miles in the UK not KM" → vandalism, infobox fixes → substantive)
- [x] Dirty JSON (prose around `{...}`) still parses to a valid label (validated: prose-wrapped `{...}` → `vandalism`)
- [x] Out-of-enum label normalizes to `unclear`; malformed/empty reply defaults to `unclear` without crashing (validated: `spam`→`unclear`, non-JSON→`unclear`/0, confidence 5→1, -2→0)

> **Validation note (env-specific):** the in-container `ollama/ollama` image
> crashes during inference on this host's arm64 Colima VM (native/cgo `fatal
> error: found bad pointer in Go heap`; older `0.24.0` OOM-crashes too) — a
> Colima VZ incompatibility, not a pipeline bug. Validated end-to-end against a
> **host-native Ollama** via `OLLAMA_ADDRESS=http://host.docker.internal:11434`
> (~4.5s/inference). The containerized default is kept for portability (Docker
> Desktop / Linux runners), with the host override documented in the README.

## Phase 6 — Confidence-based escalation (the multi-step loop)

> Goal: a structured second pass for ambiguous items — the "more than one prompt"
> agent topology.

- [ ] `switch` on `confidence < CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD || label == "unclear"` → richer escalation `branch` (more context); reuse the robust parse; set `escalated = true`
- [ ] `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` env-configurable
- [ ] Decide retries-on-bad-output explicitly: **fallback-to-`unclear` + later UPSERT correction** instead of an in-pipeline retry loop; document the why (latency/cost vs. self-correcting convergence)
- [ ] **Security:** same enum-constraint + advisory-only guarantees apply to pass 2
- [ ] **Docs:** document why two passes (cost vs. accuracy) and when escalation triggers

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] High-confidence pass-1 records skip the 2nd call (`escalated = false`)
- [ ] Low-confidence / `unclear` records trigger pass 2 (`escalated = true`)
- [ ] Lowering `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` measurably reduces escalations
- [ ] Pass-2 output is enum-normalized and crash-safe

## Phase 7 — Dual sink end-to-end + connector hardening

> Goal: persist durably and stream; make the connector production-shaped
> (retries, batching, useful logs). Removes the temporary stdout.

- [ ] `broker` fan-out: Kafka topic `wiki.edits.classified` (key = `rev_id`)
- [ ] Routing note: ONE labeled topic (`label` column) + the confidence `switch` is the routing logic (not topic-per-label) — stated so the brief's "route" requirement is traceable
- [ ] `sql_insert` to `classified_edits` with `ON CONFLICT (rev_id) DO UPDATE` (UPSERT); stamp `classified_at`; remove the temporary `stdout`
- [ ] Connector hardening: retry/backoff + batching on outputs; healthcheck-gated `depends_on`; tune the Connect logger to useful, non-spammy output
- [ ] **Security:** DSN from env; explicit `sslmode`; no creds in logs
- [ ] **Docs:** document the topic, browsing it in Console, and how UPSERT corrects cold-start `unclear` rows

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] Fresh `docker compose up` fills the dashboard with live classified edits
- [ ] Messages appear on `wiki.edits.classified` (keyed by `rev_id`) in Console
- [ ] Re-processing a `rev_id` updates the existing row (no PK collision/duplicate)
- [ ] A first-pass `unclear` row is later corrected by an UPSERT (no permanently stuck rows)
- [ ] Logs clearly show ingest → classify → sink without flooding; transient Postgres/Ollama downtime is retried, not fatal

## Phase 8 — Focused automated tests

> Goal: lock in the gnarly bits (parsing/edge cases) without a heavy harness.

- [ ] App unit tests: label filter, parameterized query, JSON serialization, empty + 503 states, and HTML-escapes-a-malicious-`<script>` title
- [ ] Parse/normalize tests for the agent's robust-output logic: dirty-JSON → first `{...}`, enum-drift → `unclear`, heartbeat dropped (not passed through)
- [ ] Wire tests into the CI `test` job
- [ ] **Security:** the escaping test doubles as an XSS regression guard
- [ ] **Docs:** README "Testing" section — how to run + what's covered

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] `pytest` passes locally and in CI; each edge case above has ≥1 assertion
- [ ] CI fails if any test fails (verify with a temporary deliberate break, then revert)

> Full Redpanda Connect test-harness coverage of every Bloblang mapping is
> **optional** (listed in Out of scope) — the parse/normalize tests cover the
> highest-risk logic at app level.

## Phase 9 — Required write-up & repro polish *(deliverable)*

> Goal: the graded README write-up and a clean one-command repro. This is the
> most heavily evaluated artifact — give it real time.

- [ ] README **Tradeoffs** section (½–1 page) — name the alternative + when you'd flip + what shaped the thinking, for two pairs:
  - [ ] Pair A: **one classification call vs. a multi-step reasoning loop** (we built the loop: pass-1 + confidence escalation)
  - [ ] Pair B: **Connect as the sink vs. app-side writes from a topic** (we chose Connect `sql_insert` UPSERT)
- [ ] README **Surprises** paragraph + **"where this breaks in production"** paragraph
- [ ] README final polish: copy-pasteable run, architecture diagram, ports table, configurable env vars
- [ ] **Security:** final pass — `gitleaks` clean on full history; localhost-only noted; deps pinned
- [ ] **Docs:** `.env.example` complete; every documented step reproducible from a fresh clone

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] A teammate following only the README reaches visible classified edits from a fresh clone
- [ ] Tradeoffs section names alternatives + flip conditions (not boilerplate)
- [ ] Surprises + production-failure paragraphs are present and specific
- [ ] `docker compose up` is the only required command (no forgotten manual steps)

## Out of scope (deliberately cut — see PRD)

These are tracked, not built, to honor the "couple-of-hours / plain but works" brief:

- **CI/CD expansion:** GHCR deploy automation, Dependabot, branch protection,
  hadolint/yamllint jobs — the brief doesn't ask for CI; what exists is kept minimal.
- **Observability stack:** metrics/counter view, dashboards, alerting (container
  logs are enough); only output retries/backoff + clean logs are in (Phase 7).
- **Full Connect test harness** for every Bloblang mapping (app-level parse tests
  cover the risky logic instead).
- Cloud/production deployment, multi-node Redpanda, managed Postgres, secrets manager.
- AuthN/AuthZ + multi-user accounts on the dashboard.
- Hosted LLM as default (local Ollama is primary; hosted left as an optional
  `.env.example` path); automated moderation actions; historical backfill.
- Multi-source ingestion (HN / USGS / GitHub) — single source by design.
